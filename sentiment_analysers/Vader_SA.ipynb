    "#### Author: Felipe Valencia - Data Scientist at Dataplicada\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This program is a vital component of a larger initiative aimed at enhancing the accuracy of sentiment analysis in customer experience tools. We are investigating the differences between three prominent sentiment analysis models: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), TextBlob, and a a fine-tune checkpoint of DistilBERT-base-uncased model. Our goal is to identify the most effective approach for implementing sentiment analysis in a web-based feedback tool, enabling businesses to upload multiple comments and reviews for evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## VADER for SA Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The program analyses customer feedback using the VADER* model to classify sentiments into a 5-star metric, which can then be used for deeper data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "_*VADER is a rule-based sentiment analysis tool tailored for social media text._\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** _As we progress, we will rigorously test VADER, TextBlob, and DistilBERT-base-uncased for this classification task, prioritising accuracy while also considering factors such as server storage, speed, and CPU usage. This comprehensive analysis will ensure we choose the best sentiment analysis option for our users, ultimately enhancing their understanding of customer feedback and improving overall service quality._"
